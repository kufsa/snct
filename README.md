Get a SNCT appointment quickly

Sometimes it can take weeks until you get a appointment with the SNCT in Luxembourg, but ever so often,
people cancel their appointments and you can get a last-minute chance to swoop in!
That's what this is about. A quick-and-dirty script to query the SNCT API and send you a e-mail
when an appointment is available in your selected window.

## Usage
  - Downlaod the script and config file. 
  - Set your time window in the configuration file.
  - Run the script with cron/systemd-timers ever so often and wait for the email.
  - If the emailed appointement fits your needs, login to the SNCT Website and get it.
  - Go one with you life.
